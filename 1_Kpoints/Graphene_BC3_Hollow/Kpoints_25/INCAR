#### Calculation Information for Lattice
# Created by Lu Niu, LukeNiu@outlook.com, May 18, 2023

## Project name
SYSTEM = Lattice

## Start parameters for this Run (default ICHARG = 2 when ISTART = 0; ICHARG = 11 for bandstructure and DOS calculation)
ISTART = 0
ICHARG = 2

## Electronic optimization (Low, Medium, High, Accurate)
PREC = Accurate
# Projected Density of States and Mulliken population analysis
# LORBIT = 11
# Defaults from POTCAR
ENCUT = 450                     # Taken from "Strain-tunable electronic..." RSC Adv., 2018, 8, 1686
# Output charge function file CHGCAR
LCHARG = .FALSE.
# Output wave function file WAVECAR
LWAVE = .FALSE.

# Alorithm for electron optimization, can be also FAST or ALL
ALGO = Normal
# of ELM steps, sometimes default is too small
NELM = 64
# Stopping-criterion for ELM
EDIFF = 1E-6
# Stopping-criterion for IOM (all forces smaller 1E-2)
EDIFFG = -1E-3
# Broadening and DOS related values (ISMEAR = -5 for tetrahedral method for DOS)
SIGMA = 0.1
ISMEAR = 0  # Gaussian Smearing

# Electron Spin (1 for single layer / 2 for double layers)
# ISPIN = 2       # 2 for spin-polarized calculations (collinear) are performed
# Magnetic moment
# MAGMON = 1

## Ionic relaxation
# Number of steps for IOM   
NSW = 128
# CG for ions, often 1 (RMM-DISS) is faster    
IBRION = 2
# Step for ionic-motion (for MD in fs)
POTIM = .5
# Stress tensor (2 for relaxation ions)
ISIF = 2

# Performance optimization
# The number of groups made, each group working on one set of k-points 
# KPAR = 1
# How many cores handling one orbital
# NCORE = 4
# Real space projection; slightly less accurate but faster 
# LREAL = .FALSE.
# Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA)
GGA = PE
# Include VdW dispersion correction
IVDW = 12

# Dipole Correction (Double layers only)
# DIPOL = .TRUE.             # Dipole correction adjusts forces and potential.
# IDIPOL = 3                  # 1 for x direction, 2 for y direction, 3 for z direction, 4 for all 3-dimensions
