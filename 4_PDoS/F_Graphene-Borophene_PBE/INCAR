#### Calculation Information for PDoS
# Created by Lu Niu, LukeNiu@outlook.com, May 18, 2023

## Project name
SYSTEM = PDoS

## Start parameters for this Run (default ICHARG = 2 when ISTART = 0; ICHARG = 11 for bandstructure and DOS calculation)
ISTART = 1
ICHARG = 11
#LCHARG = .TRUE.         # LCHARG = .TRUE. for generating CHGCAR

## Electronic optimization (Low, Medium, High, Accurate)
PREC = Accurate
# Projected Density of States and Mulliken population analysis
LORBIT = 11
NEDOS = 4000
# Defaults from POTCAR
ENCUT = 450             # Taken from "Strain-tunable electronic..." RSC Adv., 2018, 8, 1686
# Output charge function file CHGCAR
LCHARG = .FALSE.
# Output wave function file WAVECAR
LWAVE = .FALSE.

# Alorithm for electron optimization, can be also FAST or ALL
ALGO = Normal
# of ELM steps, sometimes default is too small
# NELM = 200
# Stopping-criterion for ELM
EDIFF = 1E-6
# Stopping-criterion for IOM (all forces smaller 1E-2)
EDIFFG = -1E-3
# Broadening and DOS related values (ISMEAR = -5 for tetrahedral method for DOS)
SIGMA = 0.1
ISMEAR = 0  # Gaussian Smearing
SYMPREC = 1E-6

# Electron Spin (1 for single layer / 2 for double layers)
# ISPIN = 3       # 2 for spin-polarized calculations (collinear) are performed
# Magnetic moment
# MAGMON = 1

## Ionic relaxation
# Number of steps for IOM   
NSW = 0
# CG for ions, often 1 (RMM-DISS) is faster (IBRION = -1 for time-independent)
IBRION = -1
# Step for ionic-motion (for MD in fs)
POTIM = .5
# Stress tensor (2 for relaxation ions)
# ISIF = 2

# Performance optimization
# The number of groups made, each group working on one set of k-points 
# KPAR = 1
# How many cores handling one orbital
# NCORE = 4
# Real space projection; slightly less accurate but faster 
# LREAL = Auto
