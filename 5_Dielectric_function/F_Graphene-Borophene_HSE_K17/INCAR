# Created by Lu Niu, LukeNiu@outlook.com, March 04, 2024

## Project name
SYSTEM = Dielectric_function

## Start parameters for this Run (use wavefunction from the SCF calculation)
ISTART = 1
ICHARG = 2
#LCHARG = .TRUE.         # LCHARG = .TRUE. for generating CHGCAR (not needed for optical properties)

## Electronic optimization (Low, Medium, High, Accurate)
PREC = Accurate
# Defaults from POTCAR
ENCUT = 450             # Taken from "Strain-tunable electronic..." RSC Adv., 2018, 8, 1686

# Alorithm for electron optimization, can be also FAST or ALL
ALGO = Damped
# of ELM steps, sometimes default is too small
# NELM = 200
# Stopping-criterion for ELM (1E-8 for dielectric function)
EDIFF = 1E-8
# Projected Density of States and Mulliken population analysis
#LORBIT = 11
# Number of points the dielectric function is calculated for
NEDOS = 4000

# Broadening and DOS related values (ISMEAR = -5 for tetrahedral method for DOS)
ISMEAR = 0  # Gaussian Smearing for optical properties
SIGMA = 0.01 # Set smaller for dielectric function calculation

# Use hybrid functional (PBE0) - Commonly used for optical properties
GGA = PE
LHFCALC = .TRUE.
AEXX = 0.25
HFSCREEN = 0.2

# Calculate the frequency dependent dielectric matrix
LOPTICS = .TRUE.
CSHIFT = 0.1

# Number of empty bands (this should be sufficiently large), it can be found in OUTCAR, serach 'NELECT'
NBANDS = 128

# Stress tensor (not needed for optical properties)
# ISIF = 3

# Electron Spin (depends on system)
# ISPIN = 2

# Magnetic moment (depends on system)
# MAGMON = 1

## Ionic relaxation (not needed for optical properties)
# Number of steps for IOM   
# NSW = 1
# CG for ions, often 1 (RMM-DISS) is faster (IBRION = -1 for time-independent)
# IBRION = 8
# Step for ionic-motion (for MD in fs)
# POTIM = .1

# Performance optimization
# The number of groups made, each group working on one set of k-points 
# KPAR = 1
# How many cores handling one orbital
NCORE = 16
# Real space projection; slightly less accurate but faster 
LREAL = .FALSE.
# NWRITE = 3

# Stopping-criterion for IOM (all forces smaller 1E-2) (not needed for optical properties)
# EDIFFG = -1E-3
